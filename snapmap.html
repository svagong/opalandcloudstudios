                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Snap-map provides users with the tools to explore their community, via photography. Mock-ups were
                    created in Figma, and photography was touched up in Adobe Lightroom.</p>
                <div>
                    <a
                        href="https://www.figma.com/proto/746PrQQ2waebb1bhwtSOpu/Snapmap_iOS?node-id=3%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1">iOS

                </div>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>A native platform for photography sharing, with features for searching for locations by category and
                    area. Tools are familiar in function to popular food and map exploration applications, including
                    community interactive elements. </p>
                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Photography saves those beautiful little moments, and a good photographer knows you don't need
                    impressive, breathtaking backgrounds to get a great shot. Snap map was made to help photographers
                    share locations that would be great for photography, and bring the romance of the local back.</p>
                <h2>Conceptualization and User flows</h2>
                <p>Based on my own experiences with photography apps, I created three user stories to design solutions
                    for.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users can set-up a profile and receive personalized location recommendations based on their
                        preferences.</li>
                    <li>Users can search for photo spots by location or type of photography.</li>
                    <li>Users can interact with the local photography community and leave comments and ratings on photo
                        spots.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>User flows</h3>
                <p>Writing out the user flows, the user onboards directly onto profile personalization, but always has
                    the option to skip it and come back later. This allows any user who downloaded the app for the first
                    time, on the go, to quickly use the app without delay.</p>

                <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p>To get familiar with iOS and Android, I designed wireframes for both operating systems.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
                <p>At the end of this project, I had completed designs for both Android and iOS, taking into account
                    their respective preferred navigation and styling.</p>
                <div>
                    <h4>iOS</h4>

                </div>
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Snapmap was made to help users find amazing photography spots, where ever they were. Designing the
                    familiar map and filter features, along with photo galleries and elements for community
                    interactions, all made for a highly intuitive and clean application. The goal of this project was to
                    familiarize myself with native app design in both Android and iOS systems. The resulting sets of
                    screens therefore have been tailored for each operating system, but contain the same content and
                    usability. As a life-time Android user, I went through a couple humps trying to integrate common iOS
                    features, such as a tab bar or top navigation element, and required user testing to tell me my use
                    of these elements caused redundancy (as I would include both a next button and a next icon on the
                    top and bottom of the screens) and confused users. I therefore learned a pretty beginner rule - keep
                    things simple rather than complicated. Additional choices weren't desired, they left users
                    unsatisfied with their final choice, and tired from having to make one.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>Designing for iOS was a challenge, as I have been an Android user my whole life. Many features that
                    are intuitive to me as a life-time Android user were opposite what is expected for iOS. Another
                    challenge was over-placing buttons. Users had the most to say about buttons that both ended up doing
                    the same thing, which I completely missed while working on my initial designs.</p>
                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>Not to be daunted by the differences in iOS and Android and understanding that good design is fine.
                    The two version do not need to be different for the sake of being different, and with each
                    application I make, I also begin to understand more about user-preferences and what points cause
                    frustrations.</p>
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>I particularly enjoyed choosing and placing images for this assignment, especially the welcome
                    screen's full screen images. As a photographer this app was exactly the type I would look for, and
                    picking photos that suited the “local niche spots” theme was fun as I used photos from essentially
                    my own neighborhood, and was able to explore a little on the way.</p>
