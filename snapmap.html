            </div>
           <div>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Snap-map provides users with the tools to explore their community, via photography. Mock-ups were created in Figma, and photography was touched up in Adobe Lightroom.</p>
                <div>
                    <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/746PrQQ2waebb1bhwtSOpu/Snapmap_iOS?node-id=3%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1">iOS Prototype</a>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <a href=" https://www.figma.com/proto/ivovMRLp4s2cksz8LG6sHN/SnapMap_-Android?node-id=2%3A168&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A168">Android Prototype</a>
                </div>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>A native platform for photography sharing, with features for searching for locations by category and area. Tools are familiar in function to popular food and map exploration applications, including community interactive elements. </p>
                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Photography saves those beautiful little moments, and a good photographer knows you don't need impressive, breathtaking backgrounds to get a great shot. Snap map was made to help photographers share locations that would be great for photography, and bring the romance of the local back.</p>
                <h2>Conceptualization and User flows</h2>
                <p>Based on my own experiences with photography apps, I created three user stories to design solutions for.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users can set-up a profile and receive personalized location recommendations based on their preferences.</li>
                    <li>Users can search for photo spots by location or type of photography.</li>
                    <li>Users can interact with the local photography community and leave comments and ratings on photo spots.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>User flows</h3>
                <p>Writing out the user flows, the user onboards directly onto profile personalization, but always has the option to skip it and come back later. This allows any user who downloaded the app for the first time, on the go, to quickly use the app without delay.</p>
                <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p></p>
                <div>
                    <source srcset="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/lowfi_1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/lowfi_2x.png" alt="midfi">  
                </div>
                <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Then translated these frames to mid-fidelity. At this stage, I also began to include copy that reflected my intended tone throughout the app.</p>
                <div>
                    <source srcset="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/midfi_1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/midfi_2x.png" alt="midfi">      
                </div>
                <h2>Brand Guidelines</h2>
                <h3>Color</h3>
                <p>When it came to color and tone of the app, I wanted to keep things clean and bright. White became the dominant color of the app, with blue as a supporting secondary color. White and blue together evoke calm and clear emotions. Accent colors includes orange and red, which are linked to optimism and action. My desire with this color scheme was to align with the goals of the user who chose to use my app while handling their day to day tasks.</p>
                <source srcset="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/color_palette_1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/color_palette_2x.png" alt="color">  
                <he>Typography</he>
                <p>I went with a San Serif font that was familiar, Roboto, and created a text family to use throughout the app design.</p>
                <source srcset="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/typo_icon_1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                <img src="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/typo_icon_2x.png" alt="typography">  
                <h2>Final Wireframes</h2>
                <p>The high-fidelity wireframes included as many plausible use cases as I could think of, as these screenshots do not have interactivity, including finished tasks, repeating tasks, subtasks, and tasks with deadlines.</p>
                <div>
                    <source srcset="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/highfi_1x.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                    <img src="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/highfi_2x.png" alt="highfi"> 
                </div>
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>The final screens for this project included welcome and login screens to assist users in creating user profiles, two different task views, and an example of a new task input. These screens, along with the crisp color scheme, complete the requirements of the project.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>As this project was my first foray into UI design, no user testing was conducted on these screens. Although I did still have a mentor and two peers within the field review these screens, their feedback mainly helped polish the designs. What this project lacks is actual data backing the usability, for example, of the by project view of tasks, meant to help users categorize tasks and view them one by one. Or how intuitive it actually was to create a new task. Without these feedback, the screens may be missing critical elements barring actual use.</p>
                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>A key takeaway from this project was the use of spacing to denote information hierarchy. An early iteration of these screens did not indent between the “Today” and “Work Tasks”, which a peer quickly pointed out to me would cause confusion, even with color added. A second takeaway was that the color itself mattered, and that red evoked urgency and should not be used to label tasks meant for later, but tasks for now.</p>
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>The most enjoyable part of this project was that I was designing an app I would love to use. Although no user testing was conducted, I designed using any frustrations I personally experienced with existing todo apps, and came out with more appreciation with how difficult it is to keep things simple yet highly functional. Props to all the productivity apps out there, you are doing good work.</p>
