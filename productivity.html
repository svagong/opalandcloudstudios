                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A to-do list mobile app to help users organize and track their day to days. Focused for users who are
                    students or young adults.</p>

                        Prototype</a>
                </div>
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>This project centered around designing a mobile productivity app with three key functionalities:
                    allowing users to create a user profile, make tasks lists, and mark tasks as complete. </p>
                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>As a student once upon a time, I understand that one of the biggest challenges to academics is
                    keeping yourself organized. I designed this productivity app with study plans and to-do lists in
                    mind, with a simple and straightforward aesthetic.</p>
                <h2>Conceptualization and Market Analysis</h2>
                <h3> Pattern Analysis</h3>
                <p>I am a productivity fiend who uses a variety of productivity tools in my day-to-day life. I won't
                    claim to be a digital efficiency expert, but I do know what I like and why. So on starting this
                    project, the first thing I did was turn to apps I had used before to pick out specific aspects of
                    each one I liked or disliked. This helped narrow down the design patterns I considered for this app,
                    and ultimately helped maintain my main goal for this app: keep it simple and clean.</p>
                <p>Here are some snippets from analysis on pattern use I did on other productivity apps.</p>

                <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Using what I had learned from other UI design patterns, I sketched low fidelity solutions for the
                    three key tasks outlined in the project guidelines. I particularly focused on features that would
                    help users simplify their todo list views, and how those views were hierarchically arranged, as I
                    anticipated a major need for a productivity app was being quickly accessed, viewed, and navigated.
                </p>

                        <source srcset="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/lowfi_1x.png"
                            media="(max-width:767px)">
                        <img src="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/lowfi_2x.png" alt="midfi">
                    </picture>
                </div>
                <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Then translated these frames to mid-fidelity. At this stage, I also began to include copy that
                    reflected my intended tone throughout the app.</p>
                <div>
                    <picture>
                        <source srcset="images/ProductivityApp/case_study_productivity_imgs/midfi_1x.png"

                </div>
                <h2>Brand Guidelines</h2>
                <h3>Color</h3>
                <p>When it came to color and tone of the app, I wanted to keep things clean and bright. White became the
                    dominant color of the app, with blue as a supporting secondary color. White and blue together evoke
                    calm and clear emotions. Accent colors includes orange and red, which are linked to optimism and
                    action. My desire with this color scheme was to align with the goals of the user who chose to use my
                    app while handling their day to day tasks.</p>

                <he>Typography</he>
                <p>I went with a San Serif font that was familiar, Roboto, and created a text family to use throughout
                    the app design.</p>

                <h2>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
                <p>These completed wireframes included example use cases, including finished tasks, repeating tasks,
                    subtasks, and tasks with deadlines.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>The final screens for this project included welcome and login screens to assist users in creating
                    user profiles, two different task views, and an example of a new task input. These screens, along
                    with the crisp color scheme, complete the requirements of the project.</p>
                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>As this project was my first foray into UI design, no user testing was conducted on these screens.
                    Although I did still have a mentor and two peers within the field review these screens, their
                    feedback mainly helped polish the designs. What this project lacks is actual data backing the
                    usability, for example, of the by project view of tasks, meant to help users categorize tasks and
                    view them one by one. Or how intuitive it actually was to create a new task. Without these feedback,
                    the screens may be missing critical elements barring actual use.</p>
                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <p>A key takeaway from this project was the use of spacing to denote information hierarchy. An early
                    iteration of these screens did not indent between the “Today” and “Work Tasks”, which a peer quickly
                    pointed out to me would cause confusion, even with color added. A second takeaway was that the color
                    itself mattered, and that red evoked urgency and should not be used to label tasks meant for later,
                    but tasks for now.</p>
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>The most enjoyable part of this project was that I was designing an app I would love to use. Although
                    no user testing was conducted, I designed using any frustrations I personally experienced with
                    existing todo apps, and came out with more appreciation with how difficult it is to keep things
                    simple yet highly functional. Props to all the productivity apps out there, you are doing good work.
